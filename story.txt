Jake was driving down the hauptstrasse when he realized he was missing a sock.
This for some reason made him so hungry that he decided to find some Brot at the market.
He was walking into the market where he came across a strange Hund.
His pet Dirndel turned tail and ran away immediately.
Jake chased after his pet but tripped and knocked over a shelf of freshly baked Gebaeck.
Now Jake is definitely getting to the flughafen very late.
UNLESS, he drives his brand new Porsche at max speed all the way there.
To bad though because he got distracted and ate some Apefelkuchen.
