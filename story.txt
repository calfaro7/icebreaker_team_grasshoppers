Jake was driving down the hauptstrasse when he realized he was missing a sock.
This for some reason made him so hungry that he decided to find some Brot at the market.
He was walking into the market where he came across a strange Hund.
His pet mehlhase turned tail and ran away immediately.
Jake chased after his pet but tripped and knocked over a shelf of freshly baked Gebaeck.
Now Jake is definitely getting to the flughafen very late.
UNLESS, he drives his brand new Porsche at max speed all the way there.
To bad though because he got distracted and ate some Apefelkuchen.
Atleast he had plenty of klimaanlage to keep him cool.
Forget the flight to Berlin; Jake decided to stay in the market for his vacation instead.
But his vacation proved disastrous when he was realized he was stuck because there was a scholss outside his door.
